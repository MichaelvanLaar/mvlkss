# Field: Brand Colors
#
# Used to provide a list of brand colors to choose from.
#
# ATTENTION:
# To use this field for central brand color definition it is required that you
# keep the following structure for each color (i.e. the settings under
# "options"):
#
# <color-name>:
#   lightMode: <color-value>
#   darkMode: <color-value>
#   contrastLightMode: <color-value>
#   contrastDarkMode: <color-value>
#
# The two contrast colors are typically used as text color. So please make sure
# to choose a color that provides enough contrast to the respective background
# color.
